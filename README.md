Rock Paper Scissors game created for the Odin Project
by HerrSandybell

This is my first javascript project, perscribed by <a href= https://www.theodinproject.com/>TheOdinProject</a>. The goal of the project is to create a functional Rock-Paper-Scissors game, and using the experience to get familiar with creating functions and doing some basic conditionals and arithmetic.

I tried to keep the functions as simple as straight forward as possible. You can follow along a step by step by looking at the console.

The next step of this project would be to create an interactive UI.
