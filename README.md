Rock Paper Scissors game created for the Odin Project
by HerrSandybell

This is my first javascript project, perscribed by <a href= https://www.theodinproject.com/>TheOdinProject</a>. The goal of the project is to create a functional Rock-Paper-Scissors game, and using the experience to get familiar with creating functions and doing some basic conditionals and arithmetic.

I tried to keep the functions as simple as straight forward as possible.

I think some key areas of improvement would be as follows:

- Add some sort of feedback to player choices (some kind of animation or/and sound)
- Revisit the functions and see if I can simplify them.
- Improve the design and responsiveness of the page.
